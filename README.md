# C_Learning_Journey

**Hello people!** \
This is my learning journey through the **C Programming Language**. I am breaking my progress into chapters, with notes, code examples, and practice in each one.

## Contents:
- [Chapter 1 - Basics](./Chapter-1-Basics)
- [Chapter 2 - Instructions & Operators](./Chapter-2-Instruction&Operators/)
- [Chapter 3 - Conditional Statements](./Chapter-3-Conditional_Statements)
- Chapter 4 coming soon...
